#Our proposed algorithm is based on the most robust scale estimator (Qn scale estimator). There are several other scale estimators such as median absolute deviation (MAD), interquartile range (IQR), Sn scale estimator, Hodges Lehmann estimator, etc. are present but among them, Qn scale estimator performance is more satisfactory. The Qn scale estimator having Gaussian efficiency 82%, a more efficient estimator needs fewer observations than the less efficient one to achieve a given performance. Financial companies now using these estimators on daily basis in analysis of the behaviour of stocks. The detailed analysis of Qn scale estimator is given in the subsequent section.
